## Introduzione

Se viaggiate con una compagnia aerea _low cost_ come ad esempio <span style="color: #f60;">easyJet</span> o <span style="color: #073590">RYANAIR</span> √® molto probabile che **il vostro aeroporto** di destinazione **sar√†** quello di **Berlino Sch√∂nefeld** (codice **SXF**, da non confondere con TXL che √® invece il Tegel) che si trova a circa 18 km di distanza dal centro citt√†.‚Äã

{{< img "Mappa mostra la distanza approsimativa dell'aeroporto di Berlino Sch√∂nefeld dal centro di Berlino. La distanza √® di circa 18 chilometri." "/img/articoli/distanza-sxf-berlino.jpg" "Mappa <a href=\"https://openstreetmap.org/copyright\">&copy OpenStreetMap contributors</a>">}}

‚ÄãPer i viaggiatori instancabili, si tratta di un **3-4 ore di cammino** [^1] alla scoperta della Berlino pi√π periferica. Per chi invece non se la sente, trover√† conforto in questa guida nella quale vi spiegheremo come arrivare dall'aeroporto di Berlino Sch√∂nefeld a **Berlino Centro** utilizzando i mezzi pubblici a disposizione e vi descriveremo la nostra esperienza con il trasporto ferroviario di Berlino.‚Äã

## Lista dei mezzi pubblici che effettuano collegamenti da Sch√∂nefeld a Berlino centro


### üöÜ Treno regionale
_(Consigliato)_

‚ÄãIl modo migliore per arrivare a Berlino Centro √®, _secondo il nostro parere_, attraverso il Treno _REGIO_ Airport Express, sia perch√© √® il pi√π veloce, ma anche per la comodit√† dei treni.
I treni **RE7** e **RB14** partono all'incirca ogni 30 minuti, ma arrivano molto velocemente in centro citt√†, soprattutto se alloggiate nella zonna della Torre della Televisione, visto che _Alexanderplatz_ √® una delle prime stazioni raggiunte.
Se si vuole raggiungere la stazione Centrale, il tempo di percorrenza che calcolammo √® di poco pi√π di 30 minuti.
Il viaggio **non √® proprio breve**, bisogna ammetterlo, ma √® **molto piacevole**, soprattutto se √® la vostra prima volta a Berlino. Per me lo era e devo dire di aver provato non poca emozione alla prima vista della Torre della Televisione (il treno ci passa abbastanza vicino e vi dar√† una prima prova della sua maestosit√†).

Qui sotto vi lascio **tutte le stazioni principali di Berlino** nelle quali fermano i due treni. Le informazioni sono state prese direttamente dal [sito della rete ferroviaria di Berlino](https://www.sbahn.berlin/en).

#### Biglietto, binari e costo

Il biglietto da acquistare √® il biglietto per i trasporti nella **zona ABC** di Berlino. **Il costo del biglietto √® di ‚Ç¨ 3,40** [^3].

{{< notice warning >}}
**EVITATE di acquistare i biglietti per la zona AB** per risparmiare in quanto, sebbene il tragitto sia breve, potrebbero esserci dei problemi con i controlli (abbastanza frequenti) e potreste ricevere una **multa** [^2] da parte della [BVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Verkehrsbetriebe) (la compagnia che si occupa dei trasporti nel territorio della capitale.).
{{</ notice >}}

I due treni partono dagli **ultimi binari**. Arrivate verso **la fine della lunga galleria** della stazione e seguite i **cartelli** con su scritto **RE7 / R14**, potete andare **sia a destra che a sinistra**, entrambe le vie vi porteranno sui binari. La differenza √® che da una parte ci sono le scale mentre dall'altra vi √® la salita. **Vi consiglio di usare la salita** qualora abbiate delle **valigie pesanti**.

{{< notice tip >}}
Se userete di frequente i treni nella capitale o se volete visitare anche i paesi limitrofi, date un'occhiata alla [Berlin Welcome Card](https://www.getyourguide.it/berlino-l17/berlin-welcomecard-con-guida-turistica-tascabile-t6045/?partner_id=CSSHL9T&utm_medium=online_publisher&utm_source=thatrocketx%40protonmail.com&placement=content-end&cmp=schonefeld-guida-welcome-tip)üí∞, in questo modo **risparmierete molti soldi sull'acquisto dei biglietti per treni, bus e tram**.

### üöç BUS

Sui bus **riportiamo semplicemente le informazioni** dal [sito di Berlino](https://www.berlin.de/it/). **Non abbiamo provato il viaggio in autobus** e per questo motivo non possiamo n√® consigliarlo n√® fare il contrario. Lasciamo a voi la scelta di prenderlo in considerazione o meno (considerate che i bus che partono dall'aeroporto **non arrivano in centro citt√†** e che probabilmente dovrete usare **ulteriori treni o bus**). **Noi abbiamo per√≤ viaggiato con il _Flixbus_** durante il nostro soggiorno a Berlino per andare a Dresda (diario di viaggio in arrivo), il quale ha fatto una sosta anche all'aeroporto. Vi possiamo garantire che **la strada** da Alexanderplatz all'aeroporto **non √® per niente breve** (o almeno questa √® stata la nostra sensazione).

#### Bus e fermate

üöç **X7 e 171 (EXPRESS)**: Bus diretto per la metropolitana di Rudow. Da qui potreste prendere i treni della metropolitana che arrivano nell'area che vi interessa.

üöç **163**: Gr√ºnau stazione, Adlershof stazione, Sch√∂neweide stazione

üöç **164**: Adlershof stazione, K√∂penick stazione, Kaulsdorf stazione

üöç **171**: Rudow metropolitana, Hermannplatz metropolitana


{{< img "Stazione bus dell'aeroporto di Berlino Sch√∂nefeld. Mostra due autobus parcheggiati: uno bianco e un Flixbus." "/img/articoli/bus_compressed.jpg" >}}

I bus partono dall'uscita dell'aeroporto o nel parcheggio sulla destra.

### üöá Treno S-BAHN

Durante il nostro viaggio prendemmo questo treno "_per sbaglio_" mentre ci dirigevamo verso l'aeroporto per ritornare a casa e notammo una cosa: che le stazioni erano molte di pi√π rispetto all'andata. La metropolitana dell'S-Bahn ha appunto questo problema. Il viaggio √® un po'pi√π lento a causa delle fermate aggiuntive, ma risulta comunque piacevole grazie al paesaggio di Berlino (√® stato un po'come un lento saluto per noi).

√à possibile prendere la linea **S9** della metropolitana dalla stazione dei treni (treno direzione **Spandau**), nei primi binari della stazione, **seguendo le frecce**. A differenza dei regionali, con questa linea √® possibile entrare maggiormente **nel centro citt√†** grazie alle stazioni aggiuntive, ma questo comporta un viaggio pi√π lento che viene compensato dal fatto che i treni della linea **S9** partono **ogni 20 minuti**.
Qui sotto riportiamo tutte le stazioni nelle quali si ferma la linea **S9**.

#### Fermate

üöá **S9** <span role="img" aria-label="direzione" title="direzione">‚û°Ô∏è</span> Spandau: Aeroporto Sch√∂nefeld, Gr√ºnbergallee, Altglienicke, Adlershof, Betriebsbahnhof Sch√∂neweide, Sch√∂neweide, Baumschulenweg, Pl√§nterwald, Treptower Park, Warschauer Stra√üe, Ostbahnhof, Jannowitzbr√ºcke, _Alexanderplatz_(<svg width="30" height="30" style="display:inline-block" viewBox="0 0 210 297" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g transform="matrix(1.8075 0 0 1.8075 -1516.1 329.57)"><g transform="matrix(1.1609 0 0 1.1609 -173.43 -60.475)" fill="#000" stroke="#FFF"><path d="M917.48-39.51h3.7418v70.345H917.48z" stroke-width=".50932"></path><path d="m917.23-13.38-2.5507 45.715v1.7643h9.3702V32.335l-2.7737-61.478-3.616 1.7639z" stroke-width=".26458"></path><path d="M916.91-37.301h5.0271v2.6017H916.91z" stroke-width=".50932"></path><circle cx="919.34" cy="-44.974" r="6.6587" stroke-width=".50932"></circle><path d="M916.4-59.716h5.7374v8.7932H916.4z" stroke-width=".50932"></path><path d="M918.36-103.49h1.8085v43.779H918.36z" stroke-width=".50932"></path></g></g></svg>), Hackescher Markt, Friedrichstra√üe, _Stazione Centrale Berlin Hauptbahnhof_, Bellevue, Tiergarten, Zoologischer Garten, Savignyplatz, Charlottenburg, Westkreuz, Messe S√ºd (Eichkamp), Heerstra√üe, Olympiastadion, Pichelsberg, Stresow, Spandau

#### Biglietto e costo

Il treno attraversa le zone A, B e C di Berlino, per questo motivo **√® necessario** comprare il **biglietto per la zona ABC** da **‚Ç¨ 3,40**. Come detto sopra: ATTENZIONE a **NON comprare i biglietti per la zona AB** perch√© potreste ricevere **sanzioni elevate** in caso di controlli da parte delle autorit√† tedesche.

Qui sotto trovate i tutorial su [**come raggiungere la stazione**](#-dove-acquistare-i-biglietti-dei-treni) e [**dove acquistare i biglietti**](#-dove-acquistare-i-biglietti-dei-treni):

## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Come arrivare alla stazione

Sebbene inizialmente possa sembrare complicato, arrivare alla stazione dell'aeroporto √® semplicissimo. Basta seguire i cartelli con su scritto **DB**, che sta per Deutsche Bahn, la "_Trenitalia_ tedesca".

{{< img "Pensilina con insegna che indica la via per la stazione dell'aeroporto di Berlino Sch√∂nefeld" "/img/articoli/pensilina1_compressed.jpg" >}}

Una volta usciti dall'aeroporto percorrente la lunga pensilina bianca alla vostra sinistra, ad un certo punto, sempre alla vostra sinistra, troverete delle tende blu del ristorante _Augustiner Am Flughafen_, se √® cos√¨ proseguite sempre dritto, siete sotto la pensilina giusta. Troverete un edificio, una volta entrati sarete all'interno della stazione.

{{< umap mapName="come-arrivare-a-berlino-centro-dall-aeroporto-scho_371192" >}}


## üé´ Dove acquistare i biglietti dei treni

Per acquistare i biglietti potete:

1. ‚úàÔ∏è **Acquistarli direttamente in aeroporto**. Se siete al terminal A: Appena usciti dal ritiro bagagli dell'aeroporto vi ritroverete alla vostra destra (poco prima dell'uscita dall'aeroporto) il punto _Informazioni turistiche Berlino-Brandeburgo_, nel quale potrete acquistare i biglietti semplicemente dicendo al venditore di voler andare a Berlino Centro, vi daranno i biglietti giusti e non avrete ulteriori problemi. Di solito non parlano italiano, quindi sfoderate il vostro inglese migliore (o il vostro tedesco).
2. üöâ **Acquistarli in stazione**. Una volta raggiunta la stazione sar√† possibile acquistare i biglietti dalle biglietterie automatiche installate sotto la galleria. Non sono semplicissime da usare e risultano un po'confusionarie, per questo vi consigliamo di prenderli all'aeroporto o online.
3. üíª **Acquistarli online sul sito della Deutsche Bahn**. Se volete potete anche acquistare i biglietti online sul [sito della DB](https://www.bahn.com/it/view/index.shtml) utilizzando la vostra carta di credito o PayPal.
